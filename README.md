# [WIP] My MacPro 5,1 Journey

**Note: This document is still Work In Progress**

This document describes my journey with the Mac Pro (Early 2009), originally a 4,1 flashed to a 5,1. I will ry to include some of my findings and some for people to follow along this journey if they wish to buy a used Mac Pro or upgrade to a working Mac Pro in 2020. This machine still works very well for being 10+ years old. I will try to include as many videos as possible that i have used as a reference (My YouTube playlist is added below). Before we start a quick disclaimer as always.

## Purchase

If you already have a Mac Pro skip to the next section. Let me go through my buying experience. I saw a posting on Facebook Marketplace for a Mac Pro Early 2009. After a quick and simple negotiation I got it down to $175. Here are some of the images from the post and from the negotiation.

Personally I think that the fare price for this kind of system is below $250.


## My Upgrade Journey

Now this resulted in my upgrade journey starting with a lot of research work! I did lot of the reading and searching online but never new of this fb group [Mac.Pro.Upgrade](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Mac.Pro.Upgrade). I would recommend every one on however far in this journey to join this group.

### Flashing the 4,1 to make it 5,1

I began by flashing my 4,1 to 5,1 It was a farley simple process. I will link the iFixit Guide [here]()

The steps include:
- Download the Tools & Upgrade to macOS 10.11
- Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)
- Run the Firmware Upgrade Tool
- Shut Down & Flash

The onscreen tutorial will guide you through this process.

**Difficulty Level:** Easy

**Time Required:** 10-15 min

### CPU Upgrade

### RAM Upgrade

### GPU Upgrade

### PCIE SSD Upgrade

### Wifi and Bluetooth Upgrade

I would highly recommend this upgrade as this will enable faster WiFi AC (5) standard and Bluetooth 4.0 standard. This will allow functionality such as Airdrop and unlock with Apple Watch (Series 3+). I used the following part for the upgrade:

- Mini PCI-E Adapter - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3fDIkWw)
- UFL/u.FL/IPX/IPEX RF Coaxial Extension Cord - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/30nqRet)
- WiFi Bluetooth Card BCM94360CD - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/32vAtXy)


**Difficulty Level:** Easy to Medium

**Time Required:** 30-45 min
